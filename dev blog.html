             <h3 class="bruhborder"><FONT COLOR="BLUE">This game was a very fun progect to make and we definitely learned alot from developing the trevor experience<br>
            This game started development after spring break and it was the perfect gradual re introduction into design and i believe being given the<br>
            freedom to plan our progect schedule let us develop time management skill that we didnt really have earlier.Thi sgame also let us develop these skill <br>
        in a creative way that let us make our own path.The game in the end was definitely improvable but we still did alot and developed our game maker skills <br>
